# AMP-Routing
a  CRUD Application that shows a list of products and their detail page. The user can navigate through differents pages

The app is runnable on Angular 14.2 and Node 20.11.1
Make Sure you run the appplication on Angular 14. I am figuring out to run the application with one of the latest Angular version (17/18).


Run ng serve in the project repository 

you can put anything for now as password and id on the authentification page
